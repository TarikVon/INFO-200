## Managing Time and Activities

### The Work Breakdown Structure

#### Developing a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Starts with **decomposition**:

  - Initiating with **broad concepts** and progressively **breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks**
  - Iterative process: Break down **larger ideas into smaller ones** → **smaller ones into tasks**. Stops when **each task is associated with a single deliverable**
  - All the tasks should add up to **100% of the work**

- The components of a WBS exhibit unique characteristics:

  - **Deliverable-centric**: Each activity results in a specific, tangible outcome
  - **Assignable**: Tasks can be designated to an individual or team
  - **Accountable**: Responsible person to manage performance per task
  - **Flexible**: Tasks within a WBS can vary in duration and team size

### Time Estimation Techniques

## Project Scheduling

### Using Gantt Charts for Project Scheduling

### Using PERT Diagrams

#### Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)

- PERT is a **project management tool** used to plan, organize, and control large projects. It visually outlines a project's tasks and timelines using a **network of nodes and arrows**
  -Developed in the late 1950s for the **U.S. Navy’s Polaris submarine project**, PERT significantly **reduced development time by two years**
- Main usage → Identifying **critical activities**, **optimizing schedules**, and **monitoring progress**.
  - It's particularly effective in organizing tasks that can be **completed concurrently** rather than sequentially. Quite useful for IT projects, to **help parallel smaller task execution** and improve overall efficiency
- In Microsoft Project, PERT charts are called **network diagrams**

#### PERT Diagrams elements

- Uses **arrows** to **depict project activities**
- The **length of the arrows** does **not represent the duration** of the activities
- **Circles**(or nodes), often numbered or lettered, denote events
- Nodes serve to:
  - **Acknowledge completion of activities**
  - **Show task precedence** – which tasks must be completed before others can start.

#### PERT Diagram Example

- **Circles as events** and can be identified by:
  - **Numbers** / **letters** / or any other arbitrary **form of designation**
- PERT diagrams clarify task dependencies and sequence
  - Unlike Gantt charts where precedence is not explicitly represented.
  - In the image, the requirement for Activity A to be completed before starting Activity C is clear. That is less obvious in the Gantt chart.

#### PERT - Project Duration and Critical Path Method

- A project is structured around a events → **beginning**, **middle**, and **end**
  - Example 3.16: beginning (10) and end (50)
- **To calculate project length**
  - Identify all **possible paths from start to end** → calculate the **duration of each path**
  - Example 3.16: Path 10-20-40-50 totals 15 days, while Path 10-30-40-50 totals 11 days.- Project length is determined by the **longest path**
  - Example 3.16: The project duration is 15 days
- The **longest pathway** it's also called the **critical path**
  - **Any delay** on the critical path directly **extends the overall project duration**
- Other pathways may suffer delays without affecting the project length
  - That leeway is called **slack time**
