### The Work Breakdown Structure

#### Developing a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

- Starts with **decomposition**:

  - Initiating with **broad concepts** and progressively **breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks**
  - Iterative process: Break down **larger ideas into smaller ones** → **smaller ones into tasks**. Stops when **each task is associated with a single deliverable**
  - All the tasks should add up to **100% of the work**

- The components of a WBS exhibit unique characteristics:

  - **Deliverable-centric**: Each activity results in a specific, tangible outcome
  - **Assignable**: Tasks can be designated to an individual or team
  - **Accountable**: Responsible person to manage performance per task
  - **Flexible**: Tasks within a WBS can vary in duration and team size
